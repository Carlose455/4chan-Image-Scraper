## 4chan-Media-Scraper
Scrapes images from 4chan threads. Saves media in a double directory (folder within a folder) with the name of the thread as the folder name. Has a media counter as well. 

# Prerequisites
The next thing to do is list out the prerequisites. Make sure all these are included (in order of importance):

Which OSes (OSs? OS's?) are supported
What dependencies and tools are needed
What knowledge is required

# Installation
Show installation commands. Even though programmers have magical capabilities, copy-paste is preferred (by most people).

Also, if there is a CDN, show an example of how to use it.

If you have nightly/beta versions, show how to install them too.

# Usage
Show as many usage examples as possible. Show the simplest, quickest way to use the project. There is rarely a code snippet that works all the time, so make sure to provide multiple examples if there isn't.

Bonus points if you link to the documentation!
